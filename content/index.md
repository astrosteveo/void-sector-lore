# Void Sector Archive

> *"The universe did not begin with a bang. It began with a wound."*

## What Is This?

This archive contains documents relating to a pattern of incidents involving [[concepts/substrate|substrate]] miners operating in [[locations/void-sectors|Void Sectors]]—and the [[concepts/united-mining-guild|corporate cover-up]] that followed.

**19 miners** have vanished in 18 months. The [[concepts/united-mining-guild|United Mining Guild]] knows. They voted not to investigate.

> [!warning] Classification Notice
> Some documents in this archive were obtained through unauthorized disclosure. The UMG considers possession of certain materials a violation of corporate bylaws. Read at your own risk.
