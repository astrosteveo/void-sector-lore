# Sector 33-Mu

| **Designation** | Sector 33-Mu |

## Overview

Sector 33-Mu is a [[locations/void-sectors|Void Sector]] with the second-highest concentration of [[concepts/substrate|substrate]] mining incidents after [[locations/sector-19-kappa|Sector 19-Kappa]].

Despite this danger, the [[concepts/united-mining-guild|United Mining Guild]] [[board-meeting-minutes-2407-01-15|approved new extraction operations]] in this sector during their Q1-2407 board meeting—the same meeting where they denied the safety review.

## Incident History

| Date | Operator | Outcome |
|------|----------|---------|
| 2405.10 | [REDACTED] | Missing, vessel recovered |
| 2406.04 | [REDACTED] | Missing, vessel recovered |
| 2406.04 | [REDACTED] | Missing, vessel recovered |
| 2406.10 | [REDACTED] | Missing, vessel recovered |

All incidents follow the standard pattern:
- Solo substrate extraction
- Psychological deterioration
- Cargo missing at recovery
- Vessel intact
- Black box anomalies

## Cross-Sector Phenomena

[[characters/maven-cheung|Maven Cheung]], operating in [[locations/sector-19-kappa|Sector 19-Kappa]], reported her navigation system showing her simultaneously in both 19-Kappa *and* 33-Mu:

> *"The nav display says I'm in Sector 19-Kappa and also Sector 33-Mu and also coordinates that don't exist. When I look at the readout, the numbers* shift. *Like they're deciding what they want to be."*

This suggests the [[locations/void-sectors|Void Sectors]] may not be as separate as conventional navigation assumes.

## Guild Decision

From the [[board-meeting-minutes-2407-01-15|board meeting minutes]]:

> **Chen:** Proposed expanding substrate extraction operations into Sector 33-Mu, which has shown promising survey results. **Board approved exploration permits.**

This approval came during the same meeting where [[characters/dr-helena-sarr|Dr. Sarr]] presented data showing 33-Mu as one of the five highest-risk sectors.

## Whistleblower Warning

The [[the-leak-encrypted-message|anonymous Guild insider]] specifically listed 33-Mu among sectors to avoid:

> [!danger] From the leak
> *"So if you're out there drilling into a substrate seam, and your HUD starts glitching, and you hear something that sounds like breathing, and your nav display says you're in two places at once—"*
>
> ***"Get out."***
>
> *"And if you see a miner about to run a substrate extraction op in Sector 19-Kappa or* **33-Mu** *or any of the high-risk zones—tell them about Maven Cheung."*
