# Sector 19-Kappa

> *"The nav display says I'm in Sector 19-Kappa and also Sector 33-Mu and also coordinates that don't exist."*
> — [[characters/maven-cheung|Maven Cheung]], Day 15

|---|---|
| **Designation** | Sector 19-Kappa |
| **Classification** | [[locations/void-sectors|Void Sector]] |
| **Incident Count** | 6 (highest of any sector) |
| **Substrate Concentration** | High |
| **Navigation Hazard Level** | Severe |
| **UMG Recommendation** | Standard protocols (no restrictions) |

## Overview

Sector 19-Kappa is a [[locations/void-sectors|Void Sector]] located in the outer reaches of known space. It contains dense asteroid clusters with unusually high [[concepts/substrate|substrate]] concentrations—and an equally unusual number of missing miners.

Of the 19 documented substrate extraction incidents in the past 18 months, **six occurred in Sector 19-Kappa**—more than any other sector.

---

## Characteristics

### Navigational Anomalies
Ships operating in 19-Kappa report:
- Autopilot recalculation failures
- Coordinate drift (position readings that shift while stationary)
- Duplicate ship icons on navigation displays
- Sensors detecting the same vessel in multiple locations

### Environmental Factors
- Cosmic microwave background shows impossible cold spots
- Space feels "thinner" (per miner reports)
- Particles occasionally detected that violate causality
- Time dilation effects (unconfirmed, officially denied)

### Substrate Deposits
19-Kappa contains some of the richest substrate seams ever documented. [[characters/maven-cheung|Maven Cheung]]'s extraction on Asteroid 47B yielded **74kg**—157% of initial estimates—from a seam that seemed to go "all the way down."

## Incident History

| Date | Operator | Outcome |
|------|----------|---------|
| 2405.06 | [REDACTED] | Missing, vessel recovered |
| 2405.10 | [REDACTED] | Missing, vessel recovered |
| 2406.04 | [REDACTED] | Missing, vessel recovered |
| 2406.06 | [REDACTED] | Missing, vessel recovered |
| **2406.08** | **[[characters/maven-cheung|Maven Cheung]]** | **Missing, vessel recovered** |
| 2406.12 | [REDACTED] | Missing, vessel recovered |

All six incidents share identical characteristics:
- Solo operations
- Successful substrate extraction (per logs)
- Psychological deterioration documented
- Cargo missing at recovery
- Black box timestamp anomalies
- Vessels found intact, systems operational

## The Maven Cheung Incident

The most thoroughly documented incident in 19-Kappa is [[incident-report-7743|Case IR-7743]]—the disappearance of [[characters/maven-cheung|Maven Cheung]] in August 2406.

Her [[personal-log-maven-cheung|recovered logs]] provide the most detailed account of what happens to miners in this sector:

> [!quote] Day 17
> *"I went outside to check the drill rig. I saw myself inside the ship, looking out at me. We made eye contact. I came back inside. He was gone. I don't know who was inside and who was outside."*

---

## Guild Position

Despite having **six incidents**—nearly one-third of all cases—the [[concepts/united-mining-guild|United Mining Guild]] has not placed any special restrictions on Sector 19-Kappa.

From the [[board-meeting-minutes-2407-01-15|board meeting minutes]]:

> *"We can't regulate away individual risk tolerance."*
> — Sarah Chen, VP of Operations

The sector remains open for independent contractor operations under standard protocols.

## Whistleblower Warning

The [[the-leak-encrypted-message|anonymous Guild insider]] specifically warned miners about 19-Kappa:

> [!danger] From the leak
> *"So if you're out there drilling into a substrate seam, and your HUD starts glitching, and you hear something that sounds like breathing, and your nav display says you're in two places at once—"*
>
> ***"Get out."***
>
> *"Don't trust the guidelines. Don't trust the scanners. Don't trust the Guild."*
