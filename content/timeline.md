## The Beginning

### ~13.7 Billion Years Ago
**[[the-fracture|The Fracture]]**
- The universe begins—not with a bang, but with a wound
- [[locations/void-sectors|Void Sectors]] form as "thin spots" in reality
- [[concepts/substrate|Substrate]]-containing asteroids (Fragments) scatter across space

---

## The Light Appears

### 2026.01.06
**[[concepts/trulli-beacon|First Detection of the Trulli Signal]]**
- A research station in the outer solar system detects a faint transmission from an impossible location
- The signal is already named in the detection logs: *Trulli*
- No one can explain the origin of the name or the signal
- The signal is described as "warm" and "close"—unusual terminology for astronomical observation
- One technician's margin note, later redacted: *"It's like something small is curled up at the center of everything, keeping watch."*

### 2089
**Galactic Navigation Standardized**
- The [[concepts/united-mining-guild|United Mining Guild]] establishes coordinate origin at 0, 0, 0
- Origin point chosen to match the location of the Trulli signal—broadcasting continuously for 63 years
- The beacon becomes NAV-000, the anchor of all human-charted space

## The 03:47 Pattern

<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 2rem; color: var(--vs-danger); margin: 1.5rem 0; font-family: 'JetBrains Mono', monospace;">

**03:47**

</div>

The timestamp appears repeatedly across incidents:

- Maven Cheung's clock frozen at 03:47
- Maven Cheung woke at 03:47, clock didn't move for 20+ minutes
- Whistleblower message sent at 03:47 SST
- Contact protocol references "03:47 shuttle"

Significance: <span class="redacted">Unknown</span>

## What Comes Next?

<div class="framed">

The whistleblower's projection:

> *"If incident rate continues at current trajectory, we will reach* **thirty incidents** *by end of fiscal year."*

</div>

> [!danger] The Guild's Response
> - New operations approved in [[locations/sector-33-mu|Sector 33-Mu]]
> - 2M credits allocated for contractor recruitment
> - Lobbying against new Void Sector regulations
> - **No changes to extraction protocols**
