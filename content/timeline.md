## The Beginning

### ~13.7 Billion Years Ago
**[[the-fracture|The Fracture]]**
- The universe begins—not with a bang, but with a wound
- [[locations/void-sectors|Void Sectors]] form as "thin spots" in reality
- [[concepts/substrate|Substrate]]-containing asteroids (Fragments) scatter across space

## The Incident Pattern Begins

## Incident Distribution by Sector

| Sector | Incidents | % of Total |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| [[locations/sector-19-kappa|19-Kappa]] | 6 | 31.6% |
| [[locations/sector-33-mu|33-Mu]] | 4 | 21.1% |
| 47-Theta | 4 | 21.1% |
| 8-Delta | 3 | 15.8% |
| 52-Omicron | 2 | 10.5% |
| **Total** | **19** | 100% |

## The 03:47 Pattern

The timestamp **03:47** appears repeatedly across incidents:

- Maven Cheung's clock frozen at 03:47
- Maven Cheung woke at 03:47, clock didn't move for 20+ minutes
- Whistleblower message sent at 03:47 SST
- Contact protocol references "03:47 shuttle"

Significance: **Unknown**

---

## What Comes Next?

The whistleblower's projection:

> *"If incident rate continues at current trajectory, we will reach* **thirty incidents** *by end of fiscal year."*

The Guild's response:
- New operations approved in [[locations/sector-33-mu|Sector 33-Mu]]
- 2M credits allocated for contractor recruitment
- Lobbying against new Void Sector regulations
- **No changes to extraction protocols**
