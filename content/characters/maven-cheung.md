## Overview

Maven Cheung was an independent [[concepts/substrate|substrate]] miner operating under [[concepts/united-mining-guild|United Mining Guild]] permit MC-4477. On 2406.08.14, she began what should have been a routine extraction operation on Asteroid 47B in [[locations/sector-19-kappa|Sector 19-Kappa]].

She never returned.

Her vessel, the *Claim Jumper*, was recovered 31 days later by salvage team Delta-7. The ship was intact, all systems operational—but Maven was gone. Her cargo hold, which her logs indicated contained 74kg of substrate, was empty.

---

## The Extraction

Maven's initial scans indicated a substrate seam of approximately 47kg—a significant find worth eight months of living expenses. What she discovered was far more:

- **Day 1:** 47kg estimated
- **Day 8:** 41kg extracted (operation could have ended here)
- **Day 13:** 58kg extracted
- **Day 17:** 67kg extracted
- **Day 19:** 74kg extracted (157% of initial estimate)

The seam kept going. The asteroid seemed to contain more substrate than should have been physically possible.

---

## Psychological Deterioration

Maven's [[personal-log-maven-cheung|recovered logs]] document a textbook case of what the Guild calls [[concepts/deep-space-isolation-syndrome|Deep Space Isolation Syndrome]]—though the circumstances suggest something far stranger:

### Early Signs (Days 1-5)
- Sensor glitches (duplicate ship icon)
- Persistent humming sound with no identifiable source
- Peripheral movement in empty space
- Geometric dreams

### Escalation (Days 8-17)
- Time perception anomalies (clock frozen at 03:47)
- Reflection moving independently
- Substrate seam defying physical limits
- Hum evolving into rhythmic "breathing"

### Terminal Phase (Days 19-31)
- Substrate observed "breathing" in cargo hold
- Ship unable to leave asteroid's vicinity
- Footsteps in empty corridors
- Multiple simultaneous self-observations
- Time flowing in different directions

---

## The 03:47 Phenomenon

Maven's logs contain multiple references to the time **03:47**—a timestamp that appears frozen, repeated, impossible. When her ship was recovered:

> *"Ship's clock: Still running. Still set to 03:47."*

This timestamp appears in [[the-leak-encrypted-message|other incident documentation]], suggesting a pattern the Guild has not publicly acknowledged.

---

## Official vs. Unofficial Narrative

### Guild Position
[[incident-report-7743|Incident Report #7743]] classifies Maven's disappearance as a **Class-C Occupational Loss** attributed to:
- Deep Space Isolation Syndrome
- Extended solo operation beyond recommended guidelines
- Psychological breakdown

### What the Guild Knows
According to [[the-leak-encrypted-message|leaked communications]], Maven's case is one of **19 nearly identical incidents** in 18 months. The Guild's executive board [[board-meeting-minutes-2407-01-15|voted 5-0]] to deny investigation, citing "acceptable loss ratios."

---

## Legacy

Maven Cheung has become a symbol in the growing movement questioning Guild safety protocols. The anonymous whistleblower who leaked the board meeting minutes specifically cited her case:

> *"I read Maven Cheung's logs. I read the part where he realizes the ship won't leave. Where he hears footsteps in an empty corridor. Where he sees himself standing outside the viewport."*
>
> *"And I read the board meeting minutes where Marcus Veld called that an 'acceptable loss ratio.'"*
