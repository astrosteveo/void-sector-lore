## Overview

Dr. Helena Sarr serves as Director of Safety & Compliance for the [[concepts/united-mining-guild|United Mining Guild]]. In a corporate structure that prioritizes profit over people, she represents a rare voice of conscience—one that has been systematically ignored.

---

## The Safety Review Request

On 2407.01.15, Dr. Sarr presented data to the [[board-meeting-minutes-2407-01-15|UMG Executive Board]] showing a disturbing pattern:

> [!warning] Her Findings
> - **19 incidents** in 18 months involving missing operators
> - All during [[concepts/substrate|substrate]] extraction in [[locations/void-sectors|Void Sectors]]
> - Common factors: solo operations, psychological deterioration, missing cargo, intact vessels
> - **Black box timestamp anomalies** in 14 of 19 cases

She requested authorization for a comprehensive safety review:
1. Review of substrate handling protocols
2. Evaluation of Void Sector environmental hazards
3. Possible mandatory crew requirements
4. Revision of maximum continuous exposure guidelines

**Estimated cost:** 2.4M credits over 18 months.

## The Vote

The board's response was unanimous rejection:

| Board Member | Vote | Reasoning |
|--------------|------|-----------|
| Alexis Korr (CEO) | **Against** | "Economic impact unacceptable" |
| David Okonkwo (CFO) | **Against** | "Would double labor costs" |
| Sarah Chen (VP Operations) | **Against** | "Can't regulate individual risk tolerance" |
| Marcus Veld (VP Regulatory) | **Against** | "0.15% loss rate is acceptable" |
| Jin Park (VP Contractor Relations) | **Against** | "Contractors accept the risks" |
| Yuki Tanaka (Legal) | **Abstain** | "Potential legal implications of formal vote record" |

**Final vote: 5-0 against, 1 abstention.**

## Her Response

After the vote, Dr. Sarr added a restricted addendum to [[incident-report-7743|Incident Report #7743]]:

> [!quote] From her restricted addendum
> *"This is the **nineteenth** incident in the past 18 months involving substrate extraction operations in Void Sectors where the operator went missing and cargo was not recovered."*
>
> *"I have requested a comprehensive review of substrate extraction protocols and Void Sector operational safety standards."*
>
> *"My request was denied by the Executive Board on 2407.01.15."*
>
> *"Reason cited: 'Insufficient evidence of systemic risk. Economic impact of operational restrictions deemed unacceptable.'"*
>
> *"I am documenting my objection to this decision."*

## The Whistleblower's Plea

The anonymous source who [[the-leak-encrypted-message|leaked the board minutes]] specifically asked journalists to protect Dr. Sarr:

> [!important] From the leak
> *"Dr. Helena Sarr is not the enemy. She's one of the only people in the Guild who gives a damn. If you publish this, protect her. She didn't leak this. She doesn't know I exist. Don't let them retaliate against her."*

---

## Current Status

As of 2407.03, Dr. Sarr remains in her position at the Guild. She continues to:
- Update safety advisories (as directed by the board)
- Document incidents
- File her objections in the official record

Whether she will take further action—or whether she even *can*—remains unknown.

---

## Analysis

Dr. Sarr represents the limits of working within a corrupt system. She:
- Had the data
- Made the case
- Followed proper channels
- Was overruled by economic interests

Her failure is not personal—it's structural. The system is designed to value substrate revenue over miner lives. No amount of internal advocacy can change that calculus.

The question is whether external pressure—[[the-leak-encrypted-message|leaked documents]], public outcry, regulatory intervention—can succeed where she could not.
