# Deep Space Isolation Syndrome

> *"Humans are pattern-recognition machines. Sometimes we see conspiracies where there's just randomness and bad luck."*
> — Sarah Chen, VP of Operations, [[concepts/united-mining-guild|UMG]]

## Overview

Deep Space Isolation Syndrome (DSIS) is a recognized psychological condition affecting personnel working alone in deep space environments. It is the [[concepts/united-mining-guild|Guild's]] official explanation for every substrate mining incident on record.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Classification** | Psychological disorder |
| **Risk Factors** | Solo operations, sensory deprivation, extended duration |
| **Treatment** | Return to populated environment |
| **Prognosis** | Full recovery (if detected early) |
| **Guild Recommendation** | Max 21 days continuous operation |

---

## Documented Symptoms

### Early Stage
- Auditory hallucinations
- Visual disturbances (peripheral movement)
- Sleep disruption
- Hypervigilance

### Progressive Stage
- Paranoid ideation
- Temporal disorientation
- Dissociative episodes
- Self-observation phenomena

### Terminal Stage
- Complete psychological break
- Loss of contact with reality
- Erratic behavior (cargo jettison, EVA without cause)
- Disappearance

---

## Official Position

The Guild classifies DSIS as a known hazard of solo deep-space operations. From [[incident-report-7743|Incident Report #7743]]:

> *"Solo operations in Void Sectors present elevated risk factors: prolonged isolation, minimal external sensory input, circadian rhythm disruption."*

Their recommendations:
- ✅ Maximum 21-day continuous extraction (advisory, not mandatory)
- ✅ Psychological screening (annual, recommended bi-annual)
- ✅ Buddy system (recommended, not required)
- ✅ Educational materials on symptom recognition

---

## The Problem

According to [[the-leak-encrypted-message|leaked data]], DSIS doesn't explain the pattern:

> [!warning] Statistics That Don't Fit
> - **12 of 19 victims** were within the 21-day recommended limit
> - **All 19** passed their most recent psychological screening
> - **All 19** exhibited identical symptom progression
> - **All 19** successfully extracted substrate before vanishing
> - **All 19** left behind intact vessels with no cargo

### What DSIS Explains
- Psychological deterioration ✅
- Erratic behavior ✅
- Loss of contact with reality ✅

### What DSIS Doesn't Explain
- Identical circumstances across 19 cases ❌
- Cargo disappearance (despite successful extraction) ❌
- Black box timestamp anomalies ❌
- The 03:47 phenomenon ❌
- Substrate "breathing" in cargo holds ❌
- Ships unable to leave asteroid vicinity ❌
- Self-observation from outside the vessel ❌

---

## Alternative Hypothesis

[[the-fracture|The Fracture]] suggests that what happens to substrate miners isn't psychological breakdown—it's exposure to something that breaks down the distinction between observer and observed:

> *"Why does substrate exist in a state of quantum uncertainty until it's extracted—until someone* chooses *to look at it and call it real?"*
>
> *"Why does it feel like the asteroids are* afraid *of being found?"*

The symptoms of "DSIS" may be the human mind attempting to process contact with something that operates on different rules.

## Guild Utility

DSIS serves several functions for the [[concepts/united-mining-guild|Guild]]:

1. **Classification:** Every incident can be labeled "psychological breakdown"
2. **Liability Shield:** "Known hazard" + waivers = no lawsuits
3. **Plausible Deniability:** No need to investigate substrate itself
4. **Regulatory Defense:** "We have protocols for this"
5. **Normalizing:** Makes extraordinary events seem routine

From the [[board-meeting-minutes-2407-01-15|board meeting]]:

> *"These people aren't dying in cave-ins or equipment failures. They're* disappearing. *Their cargo is disappearing. Time is behaving wrong around them. This isn't normal operational risk—"*
>
> *"Helena, you're speculating about causes. You're seeing a pattern that might not exist."*

## What [[characters/maven-cheung|Maven Cheung]] Experienced

Her [[personal-log-maven-cheung|logs]] document textbook DSIS symptoms:

| Day | Symptom | DSIS Classification |
|-----|---------|---------------------|
| 3 | Sensor glitches, auditory phenomena | Early stage |
| 5 | Peripheral movement, geometric dreams | Early stage |
| 8 | Time perception errors | Progressive |
| 11 | Self-observation, reflection anomalies | Progressive |
| 13 | Breathing sounds, temporal confusion | Progressive |
| 17 | External self-observation | Terminal |
| 21 | Substrate "breathing" | Terminal |
| 24 | Phantom footsteps | Terminal |
| ??? | "I'm going home" | — |

Every symptom fits the DSIS framework.

But DSIS doesn't explain why her ship couldn't leave. Or why her cargo vanished. Or why her clock stopped at 03:47.
