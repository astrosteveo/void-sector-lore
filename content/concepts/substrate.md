# Substrate

> *"You're not drilling into rare crystals embedded in rock. You're drilling into* space itself*—and substrate is what happens when the wound in reality bleeds."*
> — [[the-fracture|The Fracture]]

## Overview

Substrate is a crystalline material found exclusively within asteroids located in [[locations/void-sectors|Void Sectors]]. It is the most valuable commodity in known space—and potentially the most dangerous.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Appearance** | "Dark silver" or "negative shine" |
| **Composition** | Carbon and silicon (anomalous structure) |
| **Market Value** | ~20,000 credits/kg |
| **Primary Buyers** | Military, tech sector, research |
| **Extraction Risk** | **EXTREME** (undisclosed) |

---

## Properties

### Physical Characteristics
- Perfect thermal conductivity at all temperatures
- **Room-temperature superconductor** (zero electrical resistance above 400K)
- Structural integrity that *increases* under stress
- Mass present but less than expected
- Reflects light at wavelengths outside visible spectrum

### Molecular Structure
Chemical analysis shows primarily carbon and silicon—but the lattice is wrong:

> *"The lattice is recursive, fractal, self-similar at every scale down to the atomic level. It's geometry that shouldn't be stable. But it is."*

This structure defies known physics. No laboratory has successfully synthesized substrate.

---

## Extraction

Substrate cannot be detected on standard surveys. Miners find it by accident:

> *"A drill cuts through ordinary rock and hits something that* resists. *Not harder rock. Resistant in a different way. Like drilling into frozen smoke."*

### The Process
1. Locate asteroid in [[locations/void-sectors|Void Sector]]
2. Begin conventional drilling
3. Encounter substrate seam (if present—approximately 1 in 10,000 asteroids)
4. Extract using standard mining equipment
5. Store in cargo hold
6. Return to port

### The Reality
Steps 4-6 frequently do not complete as expected. See [[#Extraction Incidents|Extraction Incidents]] below.

## Economic Significance

Substrate drives the modern economy:

- **52% of [[concepts/united-mining-guild|UMG]] revenue** (441M credits in Q4-2406)
- **67% of all Guild extraction operations** now occur in Void Sectors
- Projected revenue for 2407: **1.8B credits** (+22% YoY)

From the [[board-meeting-minutes-2407-01-15|board meeting]]:

> *"Substrate extraction is our core business now."*
> — David Okonkwo, CFO

Applications include:
- Military systems (classified)
- Quantum computing
- Exotic material research
- Unknown defense applications

## The Whispers

> [!warning] Psychological Effects
> Approximately **1 in 500 miners** who extract substrate report anomalous experiences.

### Documented Symptoms
- Persistent tinnitus (no medical cause found)
- Dreams of geometric patterns resolving into impossible star charts
- Sensation of being watched during extraction
- Auditory phenomena described as "breathing"
- Visual disturbances (reflections moving independently)
- Temporal perception errors

### Official Position
The Guild classifies these as symptoms of [[concepts/deep-space-isolation-syndrome|Deep Space Isolation Syndrome]]—a known hazard of solo deep-space operations.

### Unofficial Pattern
According to [[the-leak-encrypted-message|leaked data]], **19 miners** have vanished during substrate extraction in the past 18 months, all exhibiting identical symptom progression.

## Extraction Incidents

The [[the-leak-encrypted-message|anonymous whistleblower]] revealed a pattern the Guild refuses to acknowledge:

| Factor | Frequency |
|--------|-----------|
| Solo operations | 19/19 (100%) |
| Void Sector location | 19/19 (100%) |
| Successful extraction (per logs) | 19/19 (100%) |
| Psychological deterioration | 19/19 (100%) |
| Cargo missing at recovery | 19/19 (100%) |
| Vessel intact | 19/19 (100%) |
| Operator missing | 19/19 (100%) |
| Black box timestamp anomaly | 14/19 (73%) |

## What Is Substrate?

[[the-fracture|The Fracture hypothesis]] proposes that substrate is not a material *within* asteroids—it *is* the asteroids, observed at a frequency beyond conventional matter:

> *"Substrate is what asteroids become when observed at a frequency beyond conventional matter."*
>
> *"You're drilling into* space itself*—and substrate is what happens when the wound in reality bleeds."*

The asteroids in Void Sectors are **Fragments**—shrapnel from the Big Bang, remnants of whatever the universe was torn away from.

Substrate exists in quantum uncertainty until extracted. Until someone *chooses* to look at it.

Until someone *wants* it.

## The Breathing

[[characters/maven-cheung|Maven Cheung]]'s logs document what happens when 74kg of substrate sits in a cargo hold:

> [!quote] Day 21
> *"The breathing is coming from the cargo hold."*
>
> *"I opened the bay door to check the substrate."*
>
> *"It was* moving."
>
> *"Not like it was shifting from vibration or ship movement."*
>
> *"Moving like it was* breathing."

Her cargo hold was empty when the ship was recovered.
