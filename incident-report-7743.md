## REPORT HEADER

**Case Number:** IR-7743-2407
**Incident Date:** 2406.08.14 - 2406.09.13 (estimated)
**Report Filed:** 2407.01.22
**Classification:** Class-C Occupational Loss
**Sector:** 19-Kappa
**Vessel:** *Claim Jumper* (CJ-7749)
**Operator:** Maven Cheung (Independent Contractor, Permit #MC-4477)
**Status:** Vessel recovered intact; operator missing, presumed deceased
**Investigating Officer:** Safety Inspector L. Voss (Badge #4421)

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

On 2407.01.19, salvage team Delta-7 recovered the independent mining vessel *Claim Jumper* (registry CJ-7749) in a derelict state within Sector 19-Kappa. The vessel was found adrift approximately 0.3 AU from its last logged position, with all systems operational but unmanned.

Operator Maven Cheung (age 34, 6 years experience, clean safety record) was not aboard and is presumed lost. Personal logs recovered from the ship's data core indicate the operator experienced progressive psychological deterioration during an extended substrate extraction operation.

This incident has been classified as a **Class-C Occupational Loss** due to operator exposure to environmental stressors during solo deep-space operations. No evidence of mechanical failure, third-party interference, or procedural violations was found.

**Conclusion:** Incident attributed to **isolation-induced psychosis** during extended solo operation in a Void Sector environment. No operational changes to current mining protocols are recommended at this time.

## TIMELINE OF EVENTS

### 2406.08.14 - Day 1
- Operator departed registered mining claim in Sector 19-Kappa
- Initiated substrate extraction on Asteroid 47B-19K
- All systems nominal
- Initial log entries indicate routine operation

### 2406.08.16 - Day 3
- Operator reported minor sensor anomaly (duplicate ship icon on navigation display)
- Diagnostics run; no faults detected
- Operator noted auditory phenomenon (described as "hum")
- Assessment: Normal equipment operation; operator hypervigilance

### 2406.08.21 - Day 8

- Final coherent log entry
- Operator reported total extraction of 74kg (157% over initial estimate)
- Operator stated intent to depart mining site
- Assessment: Exceptional yield; operator performance exceeded projections

### 2406.09.03-13 - Days 21-31 (estimated)
- Log entries become fragmented and unreliable
- Timestamps exhibit corruption (likely due to data storage degradation)
- Content reflects severe psychological break
- No further reliable data available

### 2407.01.19 - Recovery
- Salvage team Delta-7 located *Claim Jumper* during routine sweep
- Vessel found adrift, systems operational, no crew aboard
- No distress beacon activated
- No signs of struggle, violence, or rapid decompression
- Cargo hold: **empty** (no substrate recovered)

## FINDINGS

### Physical Evidence
1. **Vessel Condition:** Intact, all systems functional, no structural damage
2. **Life Support:** Operational; consumables depleted consistent with 31-day operation
3. **Navigation:** System logs indicate ship remained within 0.3 AU of original position
4. **Cargo:** No substrate present despite log records indicating 74kg extracted
5. **Personal Effects:** All operator belongings accounted for except EVA suit
6. **Black Box:** Data recovered; timestamp discrepancies noted (see Technical Appendix)

### Medical/Psychological Assessment
1. Operator exhibited classic symptoms of **Deep Space Isolation Syndrome (DSIS)**:
   - Auditory hallucinations
   - Visual disturbances
   - Temporal disorientation
   - Paranoid ideation
   - Dissociative episodes

2. Solo operations in Void Sectors present elevated risk factors:
   - Prolonged isolation
   - Minimal external sensory input
   - Circadian rhythm disruption
   - Substrate exposure (see below)

3. **Substrate Exposure Effects:**
   - Recent studies indicate correlation between prolonged substrate handling and mild perceptual anomalies
   - Effects are temporary and resolve upon cessation of exposure
   - No permanent psychological damage documented in controlled studies
   - Operator's extended extraction period (31 days) exceeds recommended continuous exposure duration (21 days)

### Root Cause Analysis

**Primary Contributing Factor:** Operator psychological deterioration due to extended solo operation in isolated environment (DSIS).

**Secondary Contributing Factors:**
- Prolonged substrate exposure beyond recommended guidelines
- Absence of crew for psychological support/reality checks
- Operator decision to continue extraction beyond initial target (economic pressure)
- Void Sector environmental factors (navigation drift, sensor anomalies)

**Mechanical/Procedural Factors:** None identified. Vessel operated within design parameters. Operator held valid permits and certifications.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions
- ✅ Incident logged and classified
- ✅ Operator permit status updated (missing, presumed deceased)
- ✅ Next of kin notified (standard bereavement package issued)
- ✅ Vessel *Claim Jumper* impounded for standard salvage auction

### Operational Recommendations
1. **Update safety advisories** to recommend maximum 21-day continuous substrate extraction operations
2. **Recommend** (but do not mandate) buddy-system for solo contractors operating in Void Sectors
3. **Expand** psychological screening intervals for independent operators from annual to bi-annual
4. **Provide** additional educational materials on Deep Space Isolation Syndrome recognition and mitigation

### Regulatory Recommendations
**NO CHANGES** to current substrate extraction permitting requirements.

**NO CHANGES** to Void Sector operating classifications.

**NO CHANGES** to substrate handling protocols.

**Rationale:** Incident represents isolated case of operator psychological breakdown, not systemic safety failure. Current regulations provide adequate safety framework. Operator adherence to existing guidelines (maximum extraction duration, psychological screening) would have prevented incident.

## TECHNICAL APPENDIX

### Black Box Timestamp Anomaly

The vessel's black box recorded **47,394,812 seconds** of elapsed mission time, equivalent to approximately 1.5 standard years. This conflicts with:
- Ship chronometer reading: 31 days, 4 hours, 16 minutes
- Consumables depletion: ~30 days
- Physical aging of equipment: ~30 days
- Operator's logged subjective experience: 31 days

**Analysis:** Black box timestamp overflow error. The timestamp counter likely experienced a software fault causing incorrect accumulation. This is a known issue in older hauler-class vessels using legacy timing systems.

**Recommendation:** Advisory issued to independent operators to update black box firmware (optional, not mandatory).

**Note:** Some engineering staff have proposed alternative explanations involving relativistic time dilation effects in Void Sectors. These theories lack peer-reviewed scientific support and are not considered credible by this office.

## MATERIAL LOSS ASSESSMENT

### Substrate Recovery
Operator logs indicate extraction of 74kg substrate (estimated market value: 1,480,000 credits).

No substrate was found aboard vessel during recovery.

**Possible Explanations:**
1. Operator jettisoned cargo during psychological episode
2. Cargo was never loaded (logs fabricated during psychotic break)
3. Theft by third party (unlikely; no evidence of boarding)
4. Cargo manifesting error

**Financial Impact:** Loss attributed to operator; no Guild liability. Operator's estate responsible for unfulfilled delivery contracts (standard terms).

## ADDENDUM - RESTRICTED ACCESS

**Classification:** Internal Use Only - Safety Division
**Clearance Required:** Level 3 or above
**Added By:** Dr. H. Sarr, Director of Safety & Compliance

This is the **nineteenth** incident in the past 18 months involving substrate extraction operations in Void Sectors where the operator went missing and cargo was not recovered.

Common factors across all incidents:
- Solo operations
- Void Sector locations
- Substrate extraction (successful)
- Psychological deterioration documented in logs
- Cargo missing despite extraction logs
- Black box timestamp anomalies in 14 of 19 cases
- Vessels recovered intact, no crew

I have requested a comprehensive review of substrate extraction protocols and Void Sector operational safety standards.

My request was denied by the Executive Board on 2407.01.15.

Reason cited: "Insufficient evidence of systemic risk. Economic impact of operational restrictions deemed unacceptable."

I am documenting my objection to this decision.

If incident rate continues at current trajectory, we will reach **thirty incidents** by end of fiscal year.

At what point does "isolated case" become "pattern"?
