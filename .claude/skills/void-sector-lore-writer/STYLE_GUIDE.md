# Void Sector Style Guide

The Void Sector archive is written as **documentary immersion**—text that reads like recovered official documents, personal testimony, and leaked communications. The tone is professional, precise, and increasingly unsettling as context deepens.

---

## Core Tone: Documentary Immersion

**What this means:**
- Language that feels authentic to the medium (official reports use formal registers; personal logs are conversational)
- Details that feel researched and documented
- A sense that these are *real* incidents being described, not invented fiction
- Unreliable narrators whose observations may be distorted by psychological stress

**What it doesn't mean:**
- Overly flowery or poetic language
- Exposition dressed as dialogue
- Meta-commentary or fourth-wall breaks
- Casual or comedic tone

## Voice by Document Type

### Official Reports & Corporate Documents

**Characteristics:**
- Formal, structured language
- Classification levels and permit numbers
- Euphemism instead of direct statement
- Missing information is suspicious
- Numbers disguise human cost

**Example tone:**
> *Incident Report #7743 classifies this as a Class-C Occupational Loss attributed to Deep Space Isolation Syndrome. Extended solo operation beyond recommended duration resulted in psychological deterioration and loss of personnel.*

**What's hidden:** What actually happened. Why the cargo disappeared. That this is the 6th incident in this sector.

### Personal Logs & Survivor Accounts

**Characteristics:**
- First-person, intimate perspective
- Timestamps and environmental observations
- Deteriorating lucidity as psychological stress increases
- Specific sensory details (sounds, visual anomalies, time perception)
- Informal language that becomes fragmented

**Example tone (early log, stable):**
> *Day 1, 14:22. Standard substrate scan shows 47kg seam in asteroid 47B. Salvage estimate: 8 months living expenses. Initiating extraction. Ship running nominal. Environmental controls stable.*

**Example tone (mid-deterioration):**
> *Day 13. The seam. It's not right. Initial estimate was 47kg but I've extracted 58kg and the readings keep changing. Peripheral movement again—checked the viewport, nothing. Humming started again around 08:00. Checked sensors twice. All clear.*

**Example tone (terminal phase):**
> *I'm going home. I've always been going home. I just didn't remember where home was.*

### Whistleblower Communications & Leaks

**Characteristics:**
- Urgent, revelatory tone
- Information formatted to evade detection
- Pattern recognition across multiple incidents
- Personal justification for the leak
- Coded or encrypted when possible

**Example tone:**
> *I read Maven Cheung's logs. I read the part where he realizes the ship won't leave. Where he hears footsteps in an empty corridor. Where he sees himself standing outside the viewport. And I read the board meeting minutes where Marcus Veld called that an "acceptable loss ratio."*

## Atmospheric Writing Techniques

### Precision Creates Dread

Use specific, exact details instead of vague description:

❌ **Bad:** "The asteroid felt wrong"
✓ **Good:** "Spectral readings shifted 3% between scans, despite two hours of inactivity. No geological explanation. Sensors recalibrated twice—same result."

### Accumulation Over Explanation

Build unease through layered detail, not direct statement:

❌ **Bad:** "She was going insane from the isolation"
✓ **Good:** "Day 8: Heard footsteps outside the airlock. Checked exterior cams—nothing. Day 9: Same footsteps, different pattern. Day 10: Footsteps when both airlocks sealed."

### The Timestamp Problem

The recurring appearance of **03:47** throughout incident documentation is significant. It recurs unexplained. Treat it as:
- A real phenomenon, not a coincidence
- Something the Guild notices but doesn't address
- A pattern that connects incidents
- Potentially indicating distorted time perception or actual temporal anomaly

When you encounter 03:47, the reader should feel unease because they recognize the pattern too.

### Missing Information as a Tool

Gaps, redactions, and absence of explanation create atmosphere:

> *Extraction logs indicate 74kg substrate recovered. Cargo hold, upon recovery by salvage team: empty.*

The mystery isn't explained. The contradiction stands. Let readers draw their own conclusions.

### Psychological Deterioration Structure

When documenting a character's decline:

1. **Early signs** — Small oddities, easily explained away
2. **Escalation** — Pattern becomes undeniable, character rationalizes
3. **Terminal phase** — Logic breaks down, character sees multiple realities
4. **Disappearance** — Final communication is often lucid but alien

Example from Maven Cheung's logs:
- Day 1-5: Sensor glitches, peripheral movement, strange sound
- Day 8-17: Time stops at 03:47, reflection moves independently, substrate defies limits
- Day 19-31: Sees substrate breathing, hears footsteps, observes self from outside body
- Day 31+: Gone

## Specific Language Choices

### Corporate Euphemism

The Guild disguises horror with bland language:

| Reality | Guild Classification |
|---------|---------------------|
| Miners vanishing without explanation | Class-C Occupational Loss |
| Psychological breakdown | Deep Space Isolation Syndrome |
| Impossible substrate behavior | Geological anomaly |
| Missing cargo | Extraction log discrepancy |
| Pattern of deaths | Acceptable loss ratio |

Use this in official documents. Make the gap between language and reality visible.

### Sensory Specificity

Describe what characters *experience*, not what's abstract:

❌ "The silence was oppressive"
✓ "No hum from life support. No crackle from comms. Just the sound of breathing inside the helmet, getting louder"

### Time Language

Distort time perception through word choice:

- "Two hours that felt like days"
- "The clock read 03:47. It still reads 03:47."
- "I've been extracting for 8 days. The logs say 31."
- "Time moved differently down in the asteroid"

### Permit Numbers & Designations

Use real-feeling specificity:

- Character permits: MC-4477 (Maven Cheung), DR-HS-8291 (Dr. Helena Sarr)
- Ship designations: CJ-7749 (*Claim Jumper*), SD-447 (*Substrate Dream*)
- Sector names: Sector 19-Kappa, Sector 33-Mu
- Asteroid clusters: 47B, Cluster 23-Delta

This makes the world feel documented and real.

## Avoiding Common Pitfalls

### Don't Over-Explain

❌ "The substrate was clearly some kind of sentient entity"
✓ "The extraction logs don't match the cargo scans. The seam defied physical limits. The cargo was gone."

Let readers piece together the horror. The mystery is more powerful than explanation.

### Don't Break Character

All documents should read as if they're *actually* from that universe, not written by an outside author commenting on it. No fourth-wall breaks, no knowing winks to the reader.

### Don't Make It Comical

Void Sector is atmospheric sci-fi, not comedy. Avoid:
- Sarcasm that breaks tension
- Jokes in inappropriate places
- Absurdist elements that lighten the mood

### Don't Ignore the Emotional Reality

Behind each incident is a human death. Don't treat miners as plot devices:

✓ "Maven Cheung left behind a sister on Meridian-7 Station. No one told her what happened. The Guild issued a form letter."

### Don't Forget Internal Connections

Every new piece of content should reference existing lore and deepen it. If you mention substrate, link to the concept. If you reference the Guild, connect to their documented decisions. If you write an incident, tie it to the larger pattern.

## Tone Calibration Examples

### Low Tension (Early Game/Discovery Phase)
> *Day 1, Standard substrate scan shows 47kg seam. No anomalies detected. Vessel systems nominal. Initiating extraction protocol.*

### Medium Tension (Escalation)
> *Day 8. Extraction proceeding. Current yield: 41kg. Seam appears deeper than initial scans indicated. Core samples suggest deposits extend another 30 meters minimum. Continuing operation. Sensor anomaly noted at 13:33—brief duplicate icon on nav display. Duration: 4 seconds. Equipment recalibrated. No recurrence.*

### High Tension (Deterioration)
> *I don't know how many days it's been. The log says 17 but the clock stopped at 03:47 and I don't know when that was. I see myself reflected in the viewport but the reflection moves wrong. It moves first. I move after. That's not how reflections work.*

### Maximum Tension (Terminal)
> *I'm going home. I've always been going home. I just didn't remember where home was.*
