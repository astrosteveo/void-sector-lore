### Terminal Immersion System

The wiki features a progressive corruption system that tracks your exposure:

- **Terminal Designation** — Each reader is assigned a unique VS-XXXX identifier
- **Exposure Tracking** — Time spent, pages visited, and interaction patterns are monitored
- **Progressive Themes** — Interface degrades through 6 stages as corruption accumulates:
  - TRULLI SIGNAL (safe)
  - SIGNAL DRIFT (mild corruption)
  - ISOLATION PROTOCOL (moderate)
  - SUBSTRATE RESONANCE (high)
  - COORDINATES UNKNOWN (critical)
  - TERMINAL UNRECOVERABLE (lost)
- **Ambient Horror** — Whispers in margins, ghost table entries, link misdirection, browser title corruption
- **Trulli Beacon** — A lifeline to cleanse corruption... while it still works
- **Secret Themes** — Hidden states tied to lore characters
- **The 03:47 Event** — Something happens at that time. Every time.
